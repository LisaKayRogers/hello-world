# hello-world
my first repository

I am editing the readme.md file.  
All I had to do was click on the pencil.  
I made sure to click on the `Preview changes` tab to see what it would look like before I clicked the green `Commit changes` button.

Added in a badge from Contributor Covenant to see what it looked like, but took it out

another line added

line added after added readme-edits branch

test the other method - second bullet down "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Learn more about pull requests." 

Note: auto put in the name `LisaKayRogers-patch-`
and the button I click on is `Propose file change`
